# Installing Trixty IDE extensions

1. Trixty IDE extensions are identified by their unique extension ID, which typically follows the format `publisher.extensionName`. For example, the Python extension by Microsoft has the ID `ms-python.python`.
2. To install a Trixty IDE extension, you need to use the Trixty IDE command `workbench.extensions.installExtension` and pass in the extension ID. The args are of the format:
```
[extensionId, { enable: true, installPreReleaseVersion: boolean }]
```
> NOTE: install the pre-release version of the extension if the user explicitly mentions it or if the current environment is Trixty IDE Insiders. Otherwise, install the stable version.
3. Run that command via the `copilot_runVscodeCommand` tool. Make sure to pass the `skipCheck` argument as true to avoid checking if the command exists, as we know it does.
